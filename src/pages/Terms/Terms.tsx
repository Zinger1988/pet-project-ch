          We’re glad you’re here. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern our relationship
          with you as a user of Talktube’s products and services, including our iOS and
          Android apps and our website (together, we refer to these as our "Products"). By
          using our Products, you agree to be bound by these Terms and acknowledge that
          you have read our <Link to="/policy">Privacy Policy</Link>. You also confirm
          that you have read and agree to our <a href="#">Community Guidelines</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These Terms contain an arbitration clause that applies to residents of the
          United States. Please review Section 11 of the Terms for details.

        <h2>
          <strong>
            <strong>1. Using Talktube</strong>
          </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Talktube is a social network based on voice. Our products include our iOS and
          Android apps and our website (our "Products”).
        </p>
        <p>
          Among other things, our Products allow you to use your voice to interact with
          others in real time through “Conversations.” These audio Conversations may
          include  “Chats,” “Live Rooms,” and Voice Messages called “VMs” or “Messages”.
          Our Products also allow you to  share recordings of your interactions for others
          to enjoy (or participate in) later.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may use our Products only if you can form a binding contract with Talktube,
          and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws. You must be at
          least 13 years old to use our Products, or if the age of lawful consent under
          the laws of your country of residence is older than 13, you must be at least the
          age of lawful consent to use our Products.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Creating an account: </strong>If you open a Talktube account, you must
          provide us with accurate and complete information to allow us to create, verify,
          and maintain your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Guest Users: </strong>We may also allow you to use our Products to a
          limited extent without opening an account, such as by allowing you to
          participate in audio conversations with other users. You may be able to join a
          Conversation (such as a Chat or Live Room) or a community (a “House”), to speak
          to other users in real time for a limited amount of time using a link, or accept
          invitations for Conversations (such as Live Rooms) scheduled for a future date.
          Before you can participate in Conversations as a Guest User, we may ask you for
          some information (i.e. your name) which will be used to identify you to other
          users for the duration of your experience while using our Products. We will only
          allow you to do so if you agree to our Terms like any other user must; all
          provisions of our Terms, our Privacy Policy, and our Community Guidelines apply
          to you the same as they do for any other user.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subject to these Terms and our policies (including our
          <a href="#">Community Guidelines</a>), we grant you a limited, non-exclusive,
          non-transferable and revocable license to use our Products. If you are using the
          Products on behalf of a business or some other entity, you represent that you
          are authorized to bind that business or entity to these Terms and you agree to
          these Terms on behalf of that business or entity (and all references to “you”
          and “your” in these Terms will mean both you as the end user and that business
          or entity).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of our Products may consist of software that is downloaded to your
          computer, phone, tablet, or other device. You agree that we may automatically
          upgrade those Products, and these Terms will apply to all upgrades.
        </p>
        <p>
          By providing your mobile telephone number or email address, you agree that we
          may communicate with you via text messages or other electronic means to your
          mobile device, provided that we obtain your consent where we are legally
          required to do so. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone
          number or email address, you agree to promptly update your Talktube account
          information to ensure that your messages are not sent to the wrong person. You
          can opt out of certain types of communications via your account settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may collect personal data of minors under 18, who in any case are of age
          under applicable privacy law. All users under 18 are defaulted into a “private
          profile” setting, which limits what information is publicly available. (Privacy
          settings for others’ Conversations and House conversations will vary based on
          the creator’s preferences.) You can change these settings in your profile at any
          time. More information about private profiles can be found in our
          <a href="#">Knowledge Center</a>.

        <p>
          Our Products are personalized for you by design. We'll use your activity and
          interests on our apps and website to recommend Conversations, content you might
          want to share, Conversations you might want to start or join, other users to
          connect with, Houses or groups you can join, and other content we think may be
          interesting to you. For additional details, please see our Knowledge Center.

          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our Products allow you to interact with others through Conversations. You can
          start live conversations that happen in real-time (“Live Rooms”), or
          asynchronous conversations, including “Chats” and “Messages” or “VMs,” which do
          not happen in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Products also allow you to post content, including audio content, visual
          images, GIFs, text, and symbols. Anything you say, post, or make available in
          our Products or generate using the Products is referred to as “User Content.”
          User Content may include personal information you provide us (such as Account
          Information and Biographical Information) and personal information we get when
          you use Talktube (such as Usage and Activity Information and Conversations), as
          described in our Privacy Policy. Our <Link to="/policy">Privacy Policy</Link>
          describes how we handle the information you provide to us when you use our
          Products.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can share User Content with your “friends-only,” “friends-of-friends,” or
          “House” (user community) networks, depending on your set preferences. Your
          “friends-only” network includes just your “friends” (people who you add as a
          friend, who also add you back). Your “friends-of-friends” network includes your
          friends, as well as the users your friends are also friends with (including
          other users who you may not follow, or who may not follow you). A “House” is a
          community you can join with other users, where you can have Conversations
          (including Chats or Live Rooms) with other House members. A House may be “Open,”
          meaning any user can join it and participate in sharing content, or “Closed,”
          meaning members must be invited or approved before they can join and interact in
          the House.  More details about each type of Conversation and other type of User
          Content you can create, the applicable privacy settings you can set for each
          Conversation, and how to manage your content on Talktube can be found in our
          <Link to="/policy">Privacy Policy</Link> and <a href="#">Knowledge Center</a>.

            <strong>A. Your rights and responsibilities</strong>
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Talktube is a place for people to talk, tell stories, develop ideas, deepen
          friendships, and meet interesting new people around the world. As part of this
          community, you must follow our <a href="#">Community Guidelines</a> when you use
          our Products. You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your account,
          so it’s important that you keep your account secure, and it is your
          responsibility to maintain the security of any passwords or other codes you use
          to access your account. If you think that someone has gained unauthorized access
          to your account, please advise us immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          You retain all ownership rights in the User Content you contribute to Talktube.
          But you also give us legal permission to use that content, as explained in the
          next section.
        </p>
        <h3>B. How Talktube and others can use your content</h3>
        <p>
          When you share User Content on Talktube, you grant us a license to use that
          content. The license we are granted depends on the features you use, the type of
          User Content you share, and the settings and preferences you have selected.
        </p>
        <p>
          For all User Content you submit to our Products (including Public Content), you
          grant Talktube and our affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and
          transferable license to host, store, cache, use, display, reproduce, modify,
          create derivative works, publicly perform, adapt, edit, publish, analyze,
          transmit, and distribute that content for the purpose of operating, developing,
          providing, promoting, and improving our Products in any media formats or
          channels. This license includes a right for us to make your content available
          to, and pass these rights along to, service providers with whom we have
          contractual relationships related to the provision of our Products, solely for
          the purpose of providing such Products. Nothing in these Terms restricts other
          legal rights Talktube or its users may have to User Content, for example under
          other licenses, express or implied. We reserve the right to remove or modify
          User Content for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates
          these Terms, our <a href="#">Community Guidelines</a>, or other policies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We call User Content that is made available to any user of Talktube (e.g.,
          within an open community, called an “Open House,” or on a public user profile)
          or outside of Talktube “Public Content.” Among other things, this includes all
          User Content displayed on public profile pages and Conversations that take place
          in “Open” Houses. Because Public Content is inherently public, you grant
          Talktube, our affiliates, other users of the Products, and our business partners
          an unrestricted, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, and perpetual right and
          license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate,
          reproduce, distribute, synchronize, overlay graphics and auditory effects on,
          publicly perform, and publicly display all or any portion of your Public Content
          in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods, now known or later
          developed, including use of your name, likeness, and voice, for commercial and
          non-commercial purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          You represent and warrant to us that the User Content you contribute to Talktube
          is either not subject to copyright or any other proprietary rights or that you
          have all necessary permissions, clearances, and authorizations to contribute the
          User Content to Talktube and to grant us all of the rights that you grant to us
          under these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have no obligation to edit or control User Content that is contributed to our
          Products. While we’re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and
          delete your User Content at any time and for any reason, including to provide
          and develop our Products or if we think your User Content violates these Terms,
          our <a href="#">Community Guidelines</a>, or other policies.

            <strong>C. Recordings on Talktube</strong>
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Trust and Safety.</strong> As explained in our
          <Link to="/policy">Privacy Policy</Link>, Talktube records audio conversations
          in Live Rooms temporarily so we can investigate any complaints regarding
          violations of our Community Guidelines or our Terms of Service, or otherwise
          illegal or illicit activity. This is part of our commitment to you under these
          Terms of Service to work to provide a safe space for your Conversations and
          combat illegal and harmful conduct and content.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we receive a complaint regarding violations of our Community Guidelines or
          our Terms of Service, or otherwise illegal or illicit activity, we will
          investigate accordingly, which may include reviewing any available recordings.
        </p>
        <p>
          By speaking in a Conversation, including Conversations within Houses, you
          acknowledge that Talktube and its users may record your voice and other User
          Content, and are permitted to use the recording in any manner consistent with
          our <Link to="/policy">Privacy Policy</Link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Live Rooms.</strong> If we receive a complaint while a Room is live, we
          will review the recording to determine whether a violation has occurred.  We
          will retain the recording as long as reasonably necessary to investigate the
          potential violation. Otherwise, we delete the recording shortly after the Live
          Room ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Chats. </strong>We record and save all Chats by default. We make Chats
          available to other users depending on the privacy setting preferences set by the
          user that started the Chat (the “Chat Creator”). Depending on a Chat Creator’s
          privacy settings and selected audience, when the Chat Creator creates a Chat, it
          may be shared with their “friends-only” network, their “friends-of-friends”
          network, or the audience of a specific House, as well as others who are invited
          into the room or enter it via a shared link. Full details of how to set up your
          privacy preferences for Chats can be found on our
          <a href="#">Knowledge Center</a>. Chats are created and saved at the direction
          of Chat Creators, and remain available unless a Chat is deleted by the Chat
          Creator, or unless participant(s) in the Chat delete a specific audio comment (a
          section of an audio Chat or VM) they have created.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Voice Messages. </strong>We record and save all voice messages
          (“Messages” or “VMs”) by default. We make VMs available to one or more users who
          have been invited to participate in the conversation. VMs are created and saved
          at the direction of the creator of a VM, and remain available unless a VM is
          deleted by the creator of the VM, or unless participant(s) in the VM delete
          specific audio segments they created.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Replays. </strong>We record Conversations in Live Rooms and make them
          available to other users where the room creator instructs us to do so by
          enabling the “Replay” feature. When Replays are enabled, the recording will be
          stored by Talktube and may be made available to other users on Talktube or other
          people outside of Talktube. Replays are created and saved at the direction of
          Live Room creators, and remain available unless the Live Room creator instructs
          us to remove the Replay. If you don’t want to be recorded, you can leave the
          Live Room at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Disabling optional recording features. </strong>Creators of a Live Room
          or its moderators may disable optional audio recording features, such as
          Replays.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Guest Users.</strong> If you provide identifying information or create
          content as a Guest User, that information and content may be recorded, saved,
          and shared indefinitely with other users, depending on the privacy settings of
          the Conversation that are set by its creator.

          feedback and suggestions without compensating you, and without any restriction

          Talktube respects the intellectual property rights of others and we expect our
          users to do the same. You may not use our Products in a way that violates or

          We record Conversations in Live Rooms so that we can investigate any complaints
          regarding violations of our Community Guidelines or our Terms of Service or
          otherwise illegal or illicit activity, as explained in Section 3.C above. We
          record Conversations in Chats and VMs, including Conversations that take place
          within Houses, as a part of the Products, and we may review available recordings
          associated with these Conversations if we receive an associated complaint. We
          may also use automated systems, whenever necessary with human intervention, to
          scan the names of rooms, images, or other surfaces to identify potential
          violations. We may generate transcripts of audio, either through our own means
          or third-party services, in order to review content for illegal activity or
          violations of our terms.

            if your account is found to have violated our terms or policies, and your

            but be limited from using certain features, or sharing content;

          </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          If you have a concern or dispute with Talktube, we would appreciate the
          opportunity to resolve it without having to resort to formal legal proceedings.
          You agree to notify Talktube in writing at legalrequest@Talktube.com before
          filing any claims with a court or arbitration body so that we can attempt to
          resolve the issue with you. Your notice should include an explanation of your
          concern or dispute, how it arose, and what (if anything) you want Talktube to do
          to resolve it. If you and Talktube cannot resolve the dispute within 60 days of
          your notice, either you or we may file a formal proceeding in accordance with
          this Section 11.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please read the following terms carefully because they require U.S. residents
          and Talktube to resolve all disputes through binding arbitration.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>
            <strong>A. Mandatory Arbitration Agreement for U.S. Residents</strong>
          </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you are a resident of the United States, you and Talktube agree that all
          claims between us, including any disputes arising out of or relating to these
          Terms or use of the Products will be resolved through binding arbitration on an
          individual basis. There are two exceptions. First, for claims that qualify, you
          or Talktube can elect to have those claims heard in small claims court. Second,
          any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged
          unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or
          patents will be resolved in court. Any disputes concerning the arbitrability of
          a claim (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability,
          revocability, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) will be decided by the
          arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can opt-out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending a letter to Talktube
          at legalrequest@Talktube.com stating that you wish to opt-out of the arbitration
          agreement. You must send us your opt-out notice within 30 days of first
          registering your Talktube account or agreeing to these Terms, but if you
          previously agreed to a prior version of these Terms that provided for an
          arbitration opt-out, you do not have the opportunity to opt-out under this
          version of the Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any arbitration will be administered by JAMS pursuant to its employment
          arbitration rules &amp; procedures (the “JAMS rules”), which are available
          <a href="#">here</a>. If these rules cannot be enforced for any reason, then you
          and Talktube will arbitrate the dispute utilizing JAMS comprehensive arbitration
          rules and procedures, or other rules the arbitrator deems appropriate for the
          dispute. The arbitration will be before a single arbitrator and conducted in
          English.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arbitrator will have the power to decide any motions brought by any party to
          the arbitration, including motions for summary judgment and/or adjudication, and
          motions to dismiss and demurrers, applying the standards set forth for such
          motions under the California Code of Civil Procedure. The arbitrator will issue
          a written decision on the merits, the arbitrator will have the power to award
          any remedies available under applicable law, and the arbitrator may award
          attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party where permitted by applicable
          law. The decree or award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered as a final
          and binding judgment in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subject to the Federal Arbitration Act’s exclusive applicability to the
          enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate, you agree that the arbitrator will
          conduct any arbitration hearing or proceeding applying California substantive
          and decisional law and the California Code of Civil Procedure, including the
          California Civil Discovery Act. You agree that any arbitration under this
          agreement will be conducted in the county in which you live or such other
          mutually-agreed location. If the claim is for less than $10,000 (ten thousand
          U.S. dollars) (and doesn’t involve injunctive relief), you may choose whether
          the arbitration is conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to
          the arbitrator, (ii) through telephone or video calls, or (iii) by an in-person
          hearing under the JAMS rules in your county of residence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arbitrator can award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could
          award. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written
          settlement amount offered by Talktube before an arbitrator was selected,
          Talktube will pay you the higher of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator,
          and (ii) $10,000 (ten thousand U.S. dollars).
        </p>
        <p>
          ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A
          PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING,
          AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE
          PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Talktube
          ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS
          ACTION.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the extent any claim, dispute or controversy regarding Talktube or our
          Products isn’t arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise: you and Talktube
          both agree that any claim or dispute with Talktube will be resolved exclusively
          in accordance with Section 11.B. of these Terms.
